        <h2>Good End!</h2>
        <p>
          Hark, for you have reached the <em>good end</em>!
        </p>
        <p>
          The king still reings, the cat princess still lives! With the kingdom safe, the king's sages pored over dusty tomes
          in peace and found a way to avert the apocalypse! The day is saved!
        </p>
        <p>
          But you are a time-travelling mage, and with the power of the <em>back button</em> you can try to return to the start
          and see what other futures might lie before you. Are you content with your lot in life, or do you want to <em>try again</em>?
