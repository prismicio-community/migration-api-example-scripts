        <h2>Bad End!</h2>
        <p>
          Hark, for you have reached the <em>bad end</em>!
        </p>
        <p>
          The king is deposed, the cat princess is dead! Amidst the chaos the erstwhile ruler's sages did not manage
          to find a way to avert the apocalypse and thus the world has ended! Everything is seemingly lost&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          But fret not, for you are a time-travelling mage and with the power of the <em>back button</em> you can
          try to avert this cruel fate! Are you content with your lot in life, or do you want to
          <em>try again</em>?
